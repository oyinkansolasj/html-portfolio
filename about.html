<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an aspiring Computer science student studing in Babcock University, currently in her penulimate degree level. I enjoy 
  working in peers cause it makes me realised how much knowlege one can gain while working with other, It excites me and tasks
  me more to want to work harder. 
  My favourite color is blue and black. I love trying new food everyday so I won't say i have a favourite but I do love Yam 
  and Egg sauce so yeah.
</p>

<p>I play a few sports like tennis(I won't say I'm the best but i try) and basketball, I find the sport very interesting
  especially when playing with friends, I was also a track althele yes, i said was cause i had like a bad knee injury
   so I couln't go back to that but that never stopped me from trying other sports kinda.  I read lots of novels, 
   watch animes and korean dramas(They have my heart so much).

  Another thing about me is that I love watching vlogs, all these content creator kinda vlogs, I don't know what it is 
  about it but i love, even the study vlogs it gives me so much motivation and get me active so much. I am a social person 
  despite the fact that I enjoy my own space so much but hwne it's time to go out and have fun count me in always.

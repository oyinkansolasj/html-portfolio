    Demon slayer has a fantastic animation, and filled with a lot of blockblusters.<br /> 
    It was one of the most recommendation for anyone wanting to watch anime<br />

<h3>Business Proposal</h3>
<p>It is a RomCom type of series<br /> 
    One of the first korean series i found very interesting with two leads that had their own stoies to watch from.<br /> 
    I give it a 9.5 and would also recommend for anyone to watch.

<h3>Fault of my stars</h3>
<p>Amazing sci-fi<br />
    It is shows that despite the illness and sickness of the girl, if it's true love it will last.<br /> 
    I cried so much at the end but loved every bit of it.<br /> 
    I would wish to re-watch it again as a first time.
